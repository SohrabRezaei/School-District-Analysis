# School_District

## Overview of the school district analysis

The original module had asked us to perform an analysis on several schools so that the school boards could have a reference to determine how to distribute a specific budget between schools based on their test performance. However, The challenge asked us to drop the ninth-grade results of Thomas High School and then try to figure out how such alternation has affected the previous analysis as a whole.

## Results

* How is the district summary affected?

The average math score has changed from 79 to 78.9, and the passing math percentage has changed from 75 to 74.8. The passing reading percentage has changed from 86 to 85.7. Finally, the overall passing percentage has changed from 65 to 64.9. It is noticeable that these changes are very minimal since changing the grades of one class doesn't have much influence on the scores of 15 schools.
